## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

- **App Files:**  
  Contains the primary views, including:
  - `Health.swift` – The app’s entry point.
  - `ContentView.swift` – The main view presenting a tabbed interface.
  - `MedicalTranscriptionView.swift` – Handles live transcription.
  - `MedicalRecordManagementView.swift` – Manages document uploads and records.
  - `QRCodeHealthProfileView.swift` – Displays and generates health profile QR codes.
  - `AIPoweredGuidanceView.swift` – Provides personalized health recommendations.
  
- **VoiceRecording Module:**  
  Houses all components related to voice recording functionality:
  - `Recording.swift` – A model representing an individual recording.
  - `DataController.swift` – Manages the saving, loading, and filtering of recordings.
  - `Recorder.swift` – Contains the logic for audio recording and transcription.
  - `NewRecordingView.swift` – A user interface for initiating and ending recording sessions.
  - `PlaybackView.swift` – Allows users to play back saved recordings.
  - `RecordingCellView.swift` – A custom cell view for displaying recordings in a list.
  
- **Utilities:**  
  Contains helper files such as:
  - `Colors.swift` – An extension defining custom colors directly in code.
  - `AnimatedGradientBackground.swift` – A view that creates an animated gradient background.
  - `Extensions.swift` – Useful extensions (e.g., a helper for accessing the documents directory).
